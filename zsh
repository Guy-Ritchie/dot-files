# So, after trying the zsh-autosuggestions plugin, I've found that I'm kind of liking it. But there is a problem, as the usual tab binding is set to zsh autocomplete ig? Cause, it always prints all possibilities and toggles between possibilities on pressing the tab key.
# Now, to disable that, I typed in the commands :

# zmodload -u zsh/compctl zsh/complete
# bindkey '^I' forward-word

# So, think the zsh-autocomplete plugin is much more useful that the autosuggestions plugin, and so it enable it again, I had to reinstall it,by cloning it from it's repo.
